# pynet

[cascadeth](https://github.com/cascadeth)'s work from Kirk Byers's free course "Python for Network Engineers"

Each week has a folder containing work and material gathered/presented.

note1: all emails have been converted to markdown, and all email-distribution-ified links converted to the actual web address
note2: all developed code has been written for python3, unless otherwise requested by the course or specified otherwise. It has also only been tested for Linux distributions (#!/usr/bin/python3 is the default called interpreter)
